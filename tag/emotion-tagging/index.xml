      <description>&lt;p&gt;Multimedia collections usually induce multiple emotions in audiences. The data distribution of multiple emotions can be leveraged to facilitate the learning process of emotion tagging, yet has not been thoroughly explored. To address this, we propose adversarial learning to fully capture emotion distributions for emotion tagging of multimedia data. The proposed multimedia emotion tagging approach includes an emotion classifier and a discriminator. The emotion classifier predicts emotion labels of multimedia data from their content. The discriminator distinguishes the predicted emotion labels from the ground truth labels. The emotion classifier and the discriminator are trained simultaneously in competition with each other. By jointly minimizing the traditional supervised loss and maximizing the distribution similarity between the predicted emotion labels and the ground truth emotion labels, the proposed multimedia emotion tagging approach successfully captures both the mapping function between multimedia content and emotion labels as well as prior distribution in emotion labels, and thus achieves state-of-the-art performance for multiple emotion tagging, as demonstrated by the experimental results on four benchmark databases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exploiting Multi-Emotion Relations at Feature and Label Levels for Emotion Tagging</title>
      <link>https://ustc-ac.github.io/publication/dblp-confmm-xu-ww-20/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The dependence among emotions is crucial to boost emotion tagging. In this paper, we propose a novel emotion tagging method, that thoroughly explores emotion relations from both the feature and label levels. Specifically, a graph convolutional network is introduced to inject local dependence among emotions into the model at the feature level, while an adversarial learning strategy is applied to constrain the joint distribution of multiple emotions at the label level. In addition, a new balanced loss function that mitigates the adverse effects of intra-class and inter-class imbalance is introduced to deal with the imbalance of emotion labels. Experimental results on several benchmark databases demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art works.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Capturing Dependencies among Labels and Features for Multiple Emotion Tagging of Multimedia Data</title>
      <link>https://ustc-ac.github.io/publication/dblp-confaaai-wu-wj-17/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper,we tackle the problem of emotion tagging of multimedia data by modeling the dependencies among multiple emotions in both the feature and label spaces. These dependencies,which carry crucial top-down and bottom-up evidence for improving multimedia affective content analysis,have not been thoroughly exploited yet. To this end, we propose two hierarchical models that independently and dependently learn the shared features and global semantic relationships among emotion labels to jointly tag multiple emotion labels of multimedia data. Efficient learning and inference algorithms of the proposed models are also developed. Experiments on three benchmark emotion databases demonstrate the superior performance of our methods to existing methods.&lt;/p&gt;
