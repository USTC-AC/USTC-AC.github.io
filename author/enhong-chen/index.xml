      <title>Attentive One-Dimensional Heatmap Regression for Facial Landmark Detection and Tracking</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although heatmap regression is considered a state-of-the-art method to locate facial landmarks, it suffers from huge spatial complexity and is prone to quantization error. To address this, we propose a novel attentive one-dimensional heatmap regression method for facial landmark localization. First, we predict two groups of 1D heatmaps to represent the marginal distributions of the 洧논 and 洧녽 coordinates. These 1D heatmaps reduce spatial complexity significantly compared to current heatmap regression methods, which use 2D heatmaps to represent the joint distributions of 洧논 and 洧녽 coordinates. With much lower spatial complexity, the proposed method can output high-resolution 1D heatmaps despite limited GPU memory, significantly alleviating the quantization error. Second, a co-attention mechanism is adopted to model the inherent spatial patterns existing in 洧논 and 洧녽 coordinates, and therefore the joint distributions on the 洧논 and 洧녽 axes are also captured. Third, based on the 1D heatmap structures, we propose a facial landmark detector capturing spatial patterns for landmark detection on an image; and a tracker further capturing temporal patterns with a temporal refinement mechanism for landmark tracking. Experimental results on four benchmark databases demonstrate the superiority of our method.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exploiting Self-Supervised and Semi-Supervised Learning for Facial Landmark Tracking with Unlabeled Data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Current work of facial landmark tracking usually requires large amounts of fully annotated facial videos to train a landmark tracker. To relieve the burden of manual annotations, we propose a novel facial landmark tracking method that makes full use of unlabeled facial videos by exploiting both self-supervised and semi-supervised learning mechanisms. First, self-supervised learning is adopted for representation learning from unlabeled facial videos. Specifically, a facial video and its shuffled version are fed into a feature encoder and a classifier. The feature encoder is used to learn visual representations, and the classifier distinguishes the input videos as the original or the shuffled ones. The feature encoder and the classifier are trained jointly. Through self-supervised learning, the spatial and temporal patterns of a facial video are captured at representation level. After that, the facial landmark tracker, consisting of the pre-trained feature encoder and a regressor, is trained semi-supervisedly. The consistencies among the tracking results of the original, the inverse and the disturbed facial sequences are exploited as the constraints on the unlabeled facial videos, and the supervised loss is adopted for the labeled videos. Through semi-supervised end to-end training, the tracker captures sequential patterns inherent in facial videos despite small amount of manual annotations. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the art semi-supervised facial landmark tracking methods, and also achieves advanced performance compared to fully supervised facial landmark tracking methods.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning from Macro-expression: a Micro-expression Recognition Framework</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/publication/dblp-confmm-0012-wwc-20/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As one of the most important forms of psychological behaviors, micro-expression can reveal the real emotion. However, the existing labeled micro-expression samples are limited to train a high performance micro-expression classifier. Since micro-expression and macro-expression share some similarities in facial muscle movements and texture changes, in this paper we propose a micro-expression recognition framework that leverages macro-expression samples as guidance. Specifically, we first introduce two Expression Identity Disentangle Network, named MicroNet and MacroNet, as the feature extractor to disentangle expression-related features for micro and macro expression samples. Then MacroNet is fixed and used to guide the fine-tuning of MicroNet from both label and feature space. Adversarial learning strategy and triplet loss are added upon feature level between the MicroNet and MacroNet, so the MicroNet can efficiently capture the shared features of micro-expression and macro-expression samples. Loss inequality regularization is imposed to the label space to make the output of MicroNet converge to that of MicroNet. Comprehensive experiments on three public spontaneous micro-expression databases, i.e., SMIC, CASME2 and SAMM demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.&lt;/p&gt;
